# June 2016 - 'Dystopia' Source

## Description
- This is the notable source code from a game I designed and built in June 2016 while employed at Loot Crate. Design, development, coding and implementation all done by me. Art assets by Zack Finfrock, and writing assistance by Pete Wideman.

## Background
- The month's crate theme was 'Dystopia', and I built a horizontal scrolling shooter with 'Mad Max'-inspired desert car combat.

- There are 3 levels, each with a separate enemy faction and boss. 

- Each boss has unique attack patterns and behavior.

- Development took place over 5 weeks from concept to launch.

- This code is not fully functional without the rest of the Unity project, and is only being provided here as reference.

- Fully Unity source code is available on request.
